# ti-keyboard
A conversion of the TI-99 keyboard to USB using Arduino Micro for emulation purposes

Do you have a TI-99 lying around?
Would you like to use it but have a flat panel TV where the image is less than stellar?
Do you feel you're missing out on something using an emulator?

Then why not combine the power and clear display of your emulator with the original case and keyboard of your TI?
With this project:

- Connect the TI-99 keyboard to an Arduino Micro
- Connect the USB interface of the Micro to your Raspberry PI
- Place all this on the TI-99 case after removing the mainboard
- Launch your emulator
- Profit!

*Note:* No changes or modifications are needed on the TI. This is completely reversible.
